(Adapted from the novel "Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,920
(Episode 1, A Gentleman Will Surely Take Revenge)

3
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Hey.

4
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Chi Cheng.

5
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,840
I've got a new snake.

6
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,400
Do you dare to come?

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Wait for me.

8
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,720
I'll play with you.

9
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
Yellow Dragon.

10
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
It's your turn to shine.

11
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,199
Mom. Let me do it, Mom.

12
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,559
It's okay. I'll do it.

13
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,296
I'm meeting my future daughter-in-law today.

14
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,320
Thank you, Mom.

15
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:52,480
Look, I bought Yue Yue three pounds of her favorite crawfish.

16
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
Mom.

17
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:57,719
This isn't three pounds.

18
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,919
How is that possible?

19
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,639
Ms. Liu knows I'm meeting my future daughter-in-law today.

20
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,760
She even gave me 10 more crayfish.

21
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,119
Mom, she's so out of line.

22
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,359
This doesn't weigh three pounds at all.

23
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,759
Half the bag is filled with water.

24
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,760
I'll go find her.

25
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,639
Look at you. Don't go.

26
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,040
It's not easy for Ms. Liu to run a business.

27
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
Don't cause trouble.

28
00:03:25,201 --> 00:03:26,599
- Mom. - What did I tell you?

29
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,920
It's a blessing to suffer losses.

30
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,896
The more losses you suffer, the more blessings you gain.

31
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
Yes, Mom.

32
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:32,839
That's how we've lived all these years.

33
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,079
But today is different.

34
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,160
Yue Yue is coming today.

35
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,440
That's right.

36
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,240
Why isn't she here yet?

37
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
It's fine.

38
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,679
She was always late when we went on dates.

39
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,160
She should be around the area by now.

40
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,680
It's not easy to find this place. I'll go out and pick her up.

41
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,919
He lives in such a poor place.

42
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,360
It's stinky and dirty.

43
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Yue Yue.

44
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,160
Yue Yue!

45
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
Yue Yue!

46
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,600
You're here, Yue Yue.

47
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,456
We can eat once we go inside. My mom already finished cooking.

48
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
And you know what?

49
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,560
My mom is really happy that you're here.

50
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,080
I'm not here to eat today.

51
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,560
I have something to tell you.

52
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,920
Yue Yue, go ahead.

53
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,480
Wu Qi Qiong.

54
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,560
Let's break up.

55
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
Why, Yue Yue?

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,720
Why do we have to break up?

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Didn't you promise to come to my house for a meal?

58
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Why are we breaking up all of a sudden?

59
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
All of a sudden?

60
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:40,201
I used to like you because you were at least handsome.

61
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,479
Look at you now.

62
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,200
I'm embarrassed to be with you.

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yue Yue.

64
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,696
What kind of man do you like? I can change.

65
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,320
I can change back to how I was, Yue Yue.

66
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,776
We've been together for so long.

67
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,040
We're even discussing marriage.

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,080
Wang Zhen Long, what are you doing?

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,680
Look at how useless this loser is.

70
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,880
What's the point of talking...

71
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
to someone like him?

72
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
- You can do it! - You can do it!

73
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,656
- Go, Young Master Guo! - You can do it!

74
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Go for it!

75
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:12,879
You can do it!

76
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,640
- Go for it! - Go for it!

77
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,560
Today,

78
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
you'll surely lose.

79
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,520
Weren't they best friends before?

80
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,896
Aren't they tired of fighting after all these years?

81
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,599
Whose snake do you think will win, Young Master Chi's...

82
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,000
or Young Master Guo's?

83
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,799
Isn't it obvious?

84
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,200
Young Master Chi always wins.

85
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,759
I heard Young Master Guo paid a lot to bring the black snake...

86
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,839
back from South America.

87
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,040
Today, Young Master Guo will surely turn things around.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Go for it!

89
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:01,039
Go, Young Master Guo!

90
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,199
- Kill him! - Kill him!

91
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,560
- Go for it! - Kill him!

92
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,240
Young Master Guo stands a chance!

93
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,680
- Go! - You can do it!

94
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,200
Young Master Guo is winning!

95
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Baby!

96
00:06:14,441 --> 00:06:15,520
Kill him! Go!

97
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
Bite him!

98
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,040
Bite him!

99
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Bite him!

100
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Bite him!

101
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,959
- Come on! - Come on! Bite him!

102
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Bite him!

103
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
Go for it!

104
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
He lost again.

105
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
- Yes! - Yes!

106
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:55,040
- Young Master Chi! - Nice!

107
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,720
It's okay, guys.

108
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Even if I lost...

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,160
I'm still happy!

110
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,239
Young Master Guo, you're so generous!

111
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Young Master Guo, you're awesome!

112
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:14,400
Thank you, Young Master Guo!

113
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,240
Young Master Guo, I love you!

114
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,760
Mr. Chi, you're awesome!

115
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
Don't worry.

116
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,760
I'm willing to admit defeat.

117
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,840
The prize.

118
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,440
The prize?

119
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,480
Forget it if you can't bear to part with it.

120
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
Li Wang.

121
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Come on.

122
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
Xiao Long.

123
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,480
He is my best friend, Chi Cheng.

124
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,760
Go keep him company.

125
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,160
You got him now.

126
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,480
Have fun.

127
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,000
- Chi Cheng! - Chi Cheng!

128
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,880
(Health and tranquility, no illness or disaster)

129
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,039
Dr. Jiang, I know you like desserts.

130
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,160
I made this cake especially for you.

131
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,640
- Thank you, Ms. Mei Li. - You're welcome.

132
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,759
Mr. Li.

133
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,360
This isn't good for your cervical spine.

134
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,279
- Ms. Mei Li, you look beautiful. - Use a mirror to look.

135
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,359
That's right.

136
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,879
Nini just bought me lipstick.

137
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,439
Is Wu Qi Qiong who was sent here yesterday awake now?

138
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Yes, he is.

139
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,840
Is this a present for me?

140
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,200
What a glutton.

141
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Everything is fine now.

142
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,040
- It hurts. - Don't move around.

143
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,120
I just changed your dressing.

144
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,280
Where am I?

145
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,760
You're at a clinic.

146
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,080
Your friend brought you here.

147
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,320
My friend?

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Slow down.

149
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,640
Was it a girl?

150
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,520
It was a guy and a girl.

151
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,760
That girl specifically told me...

152
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,840
to use the cheapest medicine.

153
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,720
And the kind that can be reimbursed.

154
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,080
She knows me the best.

155
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,360
Let me tell you. She's my girlfriend.

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,239
Girlfriend?

157
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Yes.

158
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:51,360
Then who's that guy?

159
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,800
That guy might be her friend.

160
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,760
Or maybe...

161
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
a friendly passerby.

162
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,600
A friendly passerby?

163
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
Hey, man.

164
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,240
I think you're being cheated on.

165
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
Okay, I admit it.

166
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Actually,

167
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,240
it's not her fault.

168
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,720
It's because I've become...

169
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,080
ugly,

170
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
tacky,

171
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,080
and fat.

172
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,280
I think...

173
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,720
you have a good foundation.

174
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Really?

175
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
Trust me.

176
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,960
You should shave first.

177
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,120
- Get a cool hairstyle. - What style do you want?

178
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
The cooler, the better.

179
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,880
Okay, can you do this hairstyle?

180
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,279
No problem.

181
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,960
Dress more neatly.

182
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,840
Losing weight is the hardest. You must persevere.

183
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,560
Have a complete makeover.

184
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,960
I'm sure your girlfriend will go back to you.

185
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
I'm here again.

186
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
- You're here. - Here.

187
00:11:13,161 --> 00:11:14,616
Congratulations, you've collected them all.

188
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,640
Thank you.

189
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,120
I did it!

190
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,399
- Hello? - Chi Cheng, where are you?

191
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,639
Your dad is in the hospital.

192
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,960
Come back quickly.

193
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,080
Okay, got it.

194
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,440
I know everything.

195
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,519
It's okay.

196
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
Young Master Chi.

197
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,319
Keep an eye on the snake.

198
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
- Okay. - Okay.

199
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,760
What's wrong? Are you jealous?

200
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,640
You Green-Eyed Monster.

201
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Mom.

202
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,120
Why did you bring this home again?

203
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,296
You're not at the hospital with Dad.

204
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,679
The caregiver is there,

205
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,160
so I came back first to wait for you.

206
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,800
- Let's go. - Where to?

207
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,840
To see Dad at the hospital.

208
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,960
There's no rush. Let's go tomorrow.

209
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,680
Your dad is asleep now anyway.

210
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,640
I should've come here tomorrow.

211
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
I'm going to bed, Mom.

212
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,520
Can't you spend more time with me at home?

213
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,080
Talk.

214
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,839
Young Master Chi, we're in trouble.

215
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,000
Someone robbed the snake den.

216
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,719
What did you say?

217
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,440
Someone robbed the snake den.

218
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,720
How did that happen?

219
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,280
I don't know.

220
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,959
I think Da Kun and I were drugged last night.

221
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,079
We slept so soundly.

222
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,200
When I woke up, it was past 9am.

223
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,280
The snakes in the glass case were all gone.

224
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,160
The ones in your room were also taken away.

225
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,960
Where's Xiao Long?

226
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,160
I don't know.

227
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,880
He was gone when I woke up.

228
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,000
Stop telling me nonsense.

229
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,120
You must find Xiao Long for me.

230
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,080
Aren't you hospitalized?

231
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,280
It was a diversion, wasn't it?

232
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,200
I knew it.

233
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,119
I've arranged everything.

234
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,919
Go and work at the company's Property Department next week.

235
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,200
Start from the bottom.

236
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
I'm taking the back door.

237
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:38,240
Try it and you'll see!

238
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,760
Look at how you are fooling around.

239
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,960
You're already 28 years old.

240
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,000
You don't even have a proper job.

241
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,760
Look at Guo Cheng Yu.

242
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,240
His company is doing so well.

243
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,639
He likes to have fun too.

244
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,360
But he's not neglecting official matters.

245
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,280
You can let him call you "Dad".

246
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,640
I'm fine with that.

247
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,960
And I wish I had a different son.

248
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,280
People have been calling my office to complain.

249
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,399
They say my son is a pervert,

250
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,599
who leads a promiscuous personal life.

251
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,960
How can I face people?

252
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,000
If you want your snakes to live,

253
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,800
go to work.

254
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,160
Table A36.

255
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,320
Table A36 is ready.

256
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,280
Yue Yue.

257
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,400
You're here.

258
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,080
Look, I've lost weight again.

259
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,696
Let's go. I'll treat you to something delicious.

260
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,880
Wu Qi Qiong!

261
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,520
Can you stop bothering me?

262
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,640
I'm here today to tell you...

263
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,400
that it's impossible between us.

264
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,320
Don't text me anymore.

265
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,080
Why, Yue Yue?

266
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,359
You complained that I was fat, sloppy,

267
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,559
and unpresentable.

268
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,160
I've changed. I can change.

269
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
It's not about being sloppy or not.

270
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,040
I just don't like how poor you are.

271
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,959
My friends are using designer bags and eating fancy food.

272
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,160
But with you,

273
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,599
I only eat ramen and spicy hot pot every day.

274
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,240
Have you ever treated me to a good meal?

275
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,840
- Aren't we here now? - A37!

276
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,800
- Is Table A37 here? - I'm here.

277
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,880
This is a popular restaurant.

278
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:30,536
- I waited in line for over an hour. - You can eat now.

279
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,800
Here's my table number.

280
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,160
I have a coupon too.

281
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,360
This coupon can only be used for weekday lunches.

282
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,160
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Yue Yue.

284
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Yue Yue.

285
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,360
Look, we're short by over 100 yuan.

286
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,719
Let's go somewhere else. Let's go to another place, okay?

287
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Let's go.

288
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,079
Look how poor you are.

289
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,920
You should find someone else to drag down too.

290
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,240
Wang Zhen Long!

291
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,479
I told you. There's no point talking to him.

292
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,560
Who are you?

293
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
What are you looking at?

294
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,120
Wu Qi Qiong,

295
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,616
your name sounds like "endless poverty".

296
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,800
With your name,

297
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,880
you'll never turn the tables in this lifetime.

298
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
Let's go.

299
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,960
Hello?

300
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,640
Hey, sir.

301
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,040
Okay. I'll be right there.

302
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,200
- Sir. - Why are you only here now?

303
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,480
You always ask me to give you projects and a raise.

304
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,400
But you're not here when I need you.

305
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,960
Why are you staring at me?

306
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,160
I asked you to come fix this.

307
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,920
Why are you looking at me? Fix it.

308
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,040
Okay. I'll fix it now.

309
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
What?

310
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,399
Sir, this is broken.

311
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,000
We need to replace this.

312
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,279
This was fine before.

313
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,320
Did you break it?

314
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
No.

315
00:18:38,441 --> 00:18:39,601
It was broken from the start.

316
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,360
Hey, Wu Qi Qiong.

317
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,240
You are...

318
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,320
too narrow-minded.

319
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,040
You should pay for this first.

320
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,240
Next month,

321
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,096
get a reimbursement from the Finance Department.

322
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,999
You haven't reimbursed me for the delivery last month.

323
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
My salary this month is less than 5,000 yuan.

324
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,079
If you think the company doesn't pay you well,

325
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,320
you can quit.

326
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,720
Don't occupy the position.

327
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,000
How dare you negotiate with me?

328
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,440
Look at yourself.

329
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
Let me tell you.

330
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,159
If you pay up quickly today,

331
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,600
this matter will be over.

332
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,200
Yue Yue thinks I'm poor and found someone else.

333
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,600
And my boss is bullying me. Everyone looks down on me.

334
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,559
I'm resigning.

335
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
I quit!

336
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Wait.

337
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
Wu Qi Qiong.

338
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,560
It's only been a few days.

339
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,120
Why are you here again?

340
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,720
I changed my name.

341
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
To what?

342
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,000
"Wu Suo Wei."

343
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm going to counterattack.

344
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
What?

345
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,240
I'm going to counterattack.

346
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,640
What attack?

347
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,439
I'm going to counterattack!

348
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,760
(I'm going to counterattack! Wu Qi Qiong)

349
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,240
- Welcome. - Welcome.

350
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,679
Thank you, Xiao Shuai, for taking me in.

351
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
It's fine.

352
00:20:35,681 --> 00:20:38,039
I was looking for someone to watch the place for me anyway.

353
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,439
- Yes! - The thing is,

354
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,879
I want to start my own business.

355
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,959
But I'm afraid my mom will find out and worry about me,

356
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,919
so it's not convenient for me to stay at home.

357
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,240
Have you decided what to do then?

358
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
Yes.

359
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,320
I'm going to sell sugar figures.

360
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,776
I'll set up a stall at the night market near Hope City.

361
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,359
I heard it's very strict there.

362
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,000
It's okay. I've already checked it out.

363
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,000
Sugar figures!

364
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Fruits!

365
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:01,560
We're managing this place so well.

366
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,920
The management fees are paid on time.

367
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,759
- The manager is here. Let's go. - Hurry, go.

368
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,640
Wait for me!

369
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,119
Sir, why are they running?

370
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,440
This street is owned by Yuanduan Group.

371
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,720
If you set up a stall here, you need a permit.

372
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,479
- If you don't have a permit, - Yuanduan Group?

373
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,639
You must run when you see people conducting an inspection.

374
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,800
Did you get a permit?

375
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,839
I run a small business and I move around a lot.

376
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,040
That's not necessary.

377
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,559
Then aren't you afraid of getting caught?

378
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,279
Come on. Let me tell you.

379
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,919
His nickname is Hei Zi.

380
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,159
He has always protected us.

381
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,839
Ordinary managers don't dare to offend him at all.

382
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
That's great!

383
00:21:34,841 --> 00:21:35,920
Melons from Xinjiang!

384
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,296
- Young Master Chi. - What are you yelling about?

385
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,600
- This bearded guy is the worst. - What?

386
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,120
Since he's powerful,

387
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,496
he always bullies the stall owners.

388
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,760
See how Hei Zi will teach him a lesson.

389
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,080
Darn you!

390
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,960
- Nice. - What are you doing?

391
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
What are you looking at?

392
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
You...

393
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,920
- You... - Darn you!

394
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,999
Sir.

395
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,520
The guy in the suit is even cooler.

396
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,320
Excuse me.

397
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,959
Serves you right.

398
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,600
Hurry, get up.

399
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,960
Young Master Chi, when it comes to these unruly hawkers,

400
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
you have to use force.

401
00:22:33,201 --> 00:22:34,560
Watch what I'll do to them.

402
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Hey.

403
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,719
Li Wang.

404
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,600
- Did you hire him? - I don't know him.

405
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Young Master Chi.

406
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,440
Go after him!

407
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,200
You bastard.

408
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,400
Don't let me catch you.

409
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,120
Let's go...

410
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,320
and meet this master.

411
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,399
What's wrong? Why are you panicking?

412
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,960
Someone's coming.

413
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,760
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

414
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Okay.

415
00:23:45,001 --> 00:23:46,039
- Hide in there first. - Okay.

416
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,200
- Don't make a sound. - Okay.

417
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,360
Don't make a sound!

418
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,760
Can I help you?

419
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm looking for someone.

420
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,159
Who?

421
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,160
Well...

422
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,480
I want to have a consultation with you.

423
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,760
Okay.

424
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
Have a seat.

425
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,599
Tell me. Where do you feel unwell?

426
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,680
Take a guess.

427
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,479
If it's a gynecological problem,

428
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,176
go to an obstetrics and gynecology hospital.

429
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,399
Go out, turn left, and walk 30 meters.

430
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,000
The No. 2 line takes you straight there.

431
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,200
You're so good-looking.

432
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,600
If you have dim eyesight,

433
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,360
go to Tongren Hospital.

434
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,040
You like men, don't you?

435
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,000
If you're mentally ill,

436
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,800
go to the mental hospital.

437
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
"Jiang..."

438
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,400
"Xiao..."

439
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,760
"Shuai."

440
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,080
I'll remember you.

441
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,919
- Is he gone? - Yes.

442
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,800
(Medical Area, Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out)

443
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,120
I encountered my nemesis.

444
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,199
I can't be a street vendor anymore.

445
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,360
I need to find another job.

446
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,840
Dr. Xiao Shuai.

447
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,000
How come you've never had a girlfriend?

448
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Because...

449
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,320
I've had a boyfriend.

450
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,640
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

451
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Wait.

452
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,680
Do you like men?

453
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
What's wrong?

454
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
Are you scared?

455
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,640
No.

456
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,200
It's okay.

457
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,680
I'll get going then.

458
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,160
When did you take it?

459
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,800
When you were talking just now.

460
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,680
My second business is about to start.

461
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,880
Wish me a triumphant return.

462
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,680
Where are you going?

463
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,319
Hello, Chi Zi.

464
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,120
You didn't come to this year's reunion again.

465
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,080
I had to entertain clients.

466
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,479
I couldn't get away.

467
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,280
What? Save it.

468
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
You,

469
00:27:17,521 --> 00:27:18,679
Guo Cheng Yu,

470
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,440
and Wang Shuo, the snake lover,

471
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,160
were so close back then.

472
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
And now...

473
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,640
Okay, guys.

474
00:27:43,641 --> 00:27:46,680
After the first two successes, let's look for the third one.

475
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,599
I found him, guys.

476
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,720
Let me show you, okay?

477
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,359
(Nice, very handsome! So tall and handsome!)

478
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,399
Isn't he nice?

479
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,119
Okay. Let's test him today.

480
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,959
We're already connected to a hidden camera.

481
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,719
I need to record the whole process later.

482
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,360
The moment we turn off our phones, a miracle will happen.

483
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,520
(So exciting! He's so handsome!)

484
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,920
Are you okay?

485
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Thank you.

486
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
You faked a fall.

487
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,320
You pretended to hold me up. Why can't I fake a fall?

488
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,560
Sir.

489
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:47,680
I'm really not a thief.

490
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,560
I'm just a vlogger.

491
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,200
I'll return the phone to you.

492
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,640
Sir, look.

493
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,160
Do you believe me now?

494
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,320
I'm really not a thief.

495
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,560
What are you doing?

496
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Sir.

497
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,999
I'm really not a thief.

498
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
It's true.

499
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,600
- You came to me yourself. - No, sir.

500
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,920
Have we met before?

501
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,040
Sir, I really have proof that I'm not a thief.

502
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
Let me show you.

503
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
Look.

504
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,960
I have an anti-pickpocket account.

505
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,200
You're just a random passerby that I picked.

506
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,879
This is to teach everyone common sense about thieves,

507
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,039
so you won't run into one.

508
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,239
It's true! The live stream viewers can vouch for me.

509
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,440
Look.

510
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
Look.

511
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,080
Am I right?

512
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:38,439
(Vlogger left for a moment. More content after the break.)

513
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
Right?

514
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,760
What's your name?

515
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Wu Suo Wei.

516
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Did you say "whatever"?

517
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,960
- You're so cocky. - No, sir.

518
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,160
My name is really Wu Suo Wei.

519
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,760
I have proof too. Wait.

520
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
Here's my ID card.

521
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,320
Look.

522
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,559
Your name is really Wu Suo Wei.

523
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,560
Yes, sir.

524
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:11,816
- It's a misunderstanding. - You've got pizzazz.

525
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,840
I don't.

526
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Darn it.

527
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,720
Why did you throw candy at me that day?

528
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,359
Sir, that day, I didn't want to throw it at you.

529
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,720
I wanted to throw it around you...

530
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
I...

531
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:30,119
I didn't want to throw it at anyone.

532
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,760
Sir, I'm sorry.

533
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,720
It's my fault.

534
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Sir.

535
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,520
Sir. Don't go, sir!

536
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
Don't.

537
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:50,920
I'll give you two choices.

538
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,320
You can either be this exposé vlogger and get beaten up by me...

539
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,520
or...

540
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,199
I'll confiscate your equipment.

541
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,240
I choose to get beaten up.

542
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
A choice has been made.

543
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,479
Sir.

544
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Give it back to me, sir.

545
00:31:06,481 --> 00:31:08,319
I bought it with a lot of money. Sir, give it back to me.

546
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,400
Sir!

547
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Young Master Chi.

548
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,040
Mr. Chi, we've brought him back.

549
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,000
He was trying to flee the country.

550
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,440
Mr. Chi.

551
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,880
Let me explain.

552
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,200
Your dad brought dozens of people to the suburbs overnight.

553
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,200
I was so scared.

554
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,360
Your dad interrogated me himself.

555
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,400
Otherwise, I wouldn't have said anything.

556
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,160
Who are you trying to freaking fool?

557
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,080
You called the Chairman's Office.

558
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,200
That phone belongs to Guo Cheng Yu's lackey, right?

559
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,319
When the chairman drove to the suburbs,

560
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,000
you were already freaking gone.

561
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
Come here.

562
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Mr. Chi.

563
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
Mr. Chi.

564
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,880
What do you guys think of him?

565
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
Not bad.

566
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,520
We all quite like him.

567
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,080
We all like you.

568
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,639
No.

569
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,080
You guys can have fun with him then.

570
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,240
I'll get going.

571
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,039
Mr. Chi.

572
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,080
Mr. Chi.

573
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,520
- Mr. Chi. - Be good.

574
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,159
- Get lost. - Mr. Chi.

575
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,840
Mr. Chi, I'm sorry.

576
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,759
Mr. Chi, it's my fault.

577
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,520
Mr. Chi!

578
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,959
Let go of me!

579
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,279
- Let go! - Watch them.

580
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,600
- Mr. Chi! - Don't let him die.

581
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,839
I'm sorry!

582
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,999
Let go of me!

583
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,160
Let go!

584
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,600
Mr. Chi!

585
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,400
Let me go!

586
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,680
(Shengshi Club)

587
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,200
Whose car is this?

588
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,880
It's in my way, you know?

589
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Darn it!

590
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,440
- Darn it. - Does he know how to park?

591
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,560
Young Master Chi.

592
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,400
Is this your car?

593
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,280
Start driving and get lost.

594
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,680
Or I'll smash it.

595
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,760
What are you waiting for? Get lost.

596
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
Idiot.

597
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,920
Only a man like him deserves me.

598
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,360
Don't touch me.

599
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,120
Focus on driving.

600
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,640
What's wrong with you today?

601
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,960
Nothing.

602
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,200
Darn it, he's flashing his lights at me.

603
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,840
- Darn it. - Slow down.

604
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,320
Let him pass.

605
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,240
Wang Zhen Long.

606
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,400
Wake up.

607
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,200
Wang Zhen Long.

608
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,640
Say something.

609
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,880
Why did you tell me to come back this time?

610
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,000
You act as if I owe you something as soon as you're back.

611
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,799
I'll give you a year.

612
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,720
If you can't find a girlfriend, marry whoever I ask you to.

613
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,440
Sure,

614
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:13,641
if she's not afraid of snakes.

615
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,440
Do you have to have that thing with you?

616
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,759
Our son doesn't have a girlfriend yet.

617
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,840
No matter what you say now, he won't listen.

618
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,559
When he gets a girlfriend,

619
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,199
he'll know his priorities.

620
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Right, son?

621
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Let me ask you.

622
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,319
Wang's son is paralyzed from the waist down.

623
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,840
Do you have anything to do with it?

624
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,040
Who is it?

625
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,599
I don't know him.

626
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,799
You'd better not.

627
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,920
Come on, Green-Eyed Monster.

628
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,800
Let's go home and sleep.

629
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,240
You're leaving again?

630
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,080
I wonder who he got his bad temper from.

631
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,720
What do you think?

632
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,840
You're finally here.

633
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,960
Xiao Shuai, you're still here?

634
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,560
I forgot you like men.

635
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,919
Are you trying to avoid me...

636
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,280
or seduce me?

637
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,240
I'm sorry.

638
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,760
What's wrong?

639
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,680
It's like someone owes you eight million yuan.

640
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,200
Don't get me started.

641
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,120
I can't do live streaming anymore.

642
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,520
My equipment was confiscated.

643
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,360
If you can't do it, just quit it.

644
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,040
Help me think.

645
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,080
Is there anything else I can do?

646
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,120
I have a relative who has a truck.

647
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,000
He usually just delivers stuff.

648
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,640
Why don't you work with them first?

649
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,680
You get paid per order.

650
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,760
And your time is flexible.

651
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
That's good.

652
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,000
I'm sorry.

653
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
You've recovered?

654
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,280
Seeing you makes me all better.

655
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
How cheesy.

656
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,560
You feel cold?

657
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,160
I've been standing here outside.

658
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,040
Of course I feel cold.

659
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,960
There's a python in my car.

660
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,520
I love snakes.

661
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,840
I'll go take a look.

662
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,040
This snake...

663
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,120
is so cute.

664
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,600
All right.

665
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,400
I can use you to deal with my dad...

666
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,400
and get my snakes back.

667
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,840
We've searched everywhere.

668
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,079
We're also keeping an eye on the chairman's car.

669
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,319
But the chairman always just goes to two places,

670
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,920
the office and home.

671
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,840
He doesn't go anywhere else.

672
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,240
Can they possibly be in the office?

673
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
I don't think so.

674
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,960
With so many snakes,

675
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,679
aside from having a big enclosure,

676
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,080
they need people to supervise them.

677
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,640
If they're in the office,

678
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,880
it won't go unnoticed.

679
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,360
Have you forgotten?

680
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,640
They built a new storage base in the office.

681
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,440
Xiao Wu.

682
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,680
Since Xiao Shuai referred you, I feel at ease.

683
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,319
But I have to remind you.

684
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,776
This batch of goods is very important.

685
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,880
We need the chairman's approval to unload the goods.

686
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,320
Don't worry.

687
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,679
For this batch of goods,

688
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,839
no one can open it.

689
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,840
I assure you.

690
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,440
Okay, I believe you.

691
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
Here.

692
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,720
Okay, stop.

693
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,560
Sir.

694
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,880
Here.

695
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,239
What's in the truck?

696
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
Open it.

697
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:23,560
Who are you?

698
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,200
Why should I open it for you?

699
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,039
The chairman said...

700
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,000
no one can open this batch of goods.

701
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360
Mr. Chi.

702
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,560
- We found the snakes. - What's going on?

703
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,679
He works for Young Master Chi.

704
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,680
Just open it for him.

705
00:42:40,681 --> 00:42:42,199
Who is Young Master Chi?

706
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,359
No one can open it.

707
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,479
- Why would I open it for no reason? - Here! Come on!

708
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,280
- You're delaying me from earning money. - Here.

709
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,520
Gang Zi.

710
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,920
Come, pry it open for me.

711
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,360
You can't open this truck!

712
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,159
I promised no one could open it.

713
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,399
Why are you yelling?

714
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,040
- I am not just anyone. - Come on.

715
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,560
Mr. Chi.

716
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,480
It's full of spare parts.

717
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,720
Didn't you say you found it?

718
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,879
Darn it, who told you to open my truck?

719
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,479
You have a truck full of spare parts.

720
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,759
Why are you being so mysterious?

721
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,720
I won't get paid this way.

722
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,040
And you.

723
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,080
Gosh.

724
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,840
- It's you again. - It's you again.

725
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,000
What do you freaking want?

726
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,520
You're involved in everything I do.

727
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,120
Who are you?

728
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,040
This is Mr. Chi from the Storage Department.

729
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,919
The Storage Department?

730
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,399
I don't care which department you're from.

731
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,400
Pay up.

732
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,440
- How much? - Five hundred yuan.

733
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,120
Gang Zi.

734
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,440
Pay him 5,000 yuan.

735
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,680
Come on, over here.

736
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,840
Chi Cheng!

737
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,559
- Mr. Chi's girlfriend is so pretty. - Yes.

738
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,560
She's so beautiful.

739
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,960
Why are you here?

740
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,680
I was afraid I wouldn't be able to catch you after you get off work.

741
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,880
- So sweet. - So sweet.

742
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,840
What? Are you envious?

743
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,120
Did you miss me?

744
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,480
Let's go.

745
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,759
Okay.

746
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,760
Let's go.

747
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:49,200
No wonder you've been picking a fight with me.

748
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,880
I messed up a few jobs because of you.

749
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:54,000
So you're Yue Yue's new boyfriend.

750
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,200
You're doing this for her to get back at me.

751
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,120
A gentleman...

752
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,680
will surely take revenge.
