(Adapted from the novel "Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

01:24.200 --> 01:27.920
(Episode 1, A Gentleman Will Surely Take Revenge)

02:01.800 --> 02:02.800
Hey.

02:02.800 --> 02:03.800
Chi Cheng.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.840
I've got a new snake.

02:06.280 --> 02:07.400
Do you dare to come?

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Wait for me.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.720
I'll play with you.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.240
Yellow Dragon.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.320
It's your turn to shine.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.199
Mom. Let me do it, Mom.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.559
It's okay. I'll do it.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.296
I'm meeting my future daughter-in-law today.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.320
Thank you, Mom.

02:49.321 --> 02:52.480
Look, I bought Yue Yue three pounds of her favorite crawfish.

02:54.760 --> 02:55.760
Mom.

02:55.761 --> 02:57.719
This isn't three pounds.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.919
How is that possible?

02:58.920 --> 03:01.639
Ms. Liu knows I'm meeting my future daughter-in-law today.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.760
She even gave me 10 more crayfish.

03:14.240 --> 03:16.119
Mom, she's so out of line.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.359
This doesn't weigh three pounds at all.

03:17.360 --> 03:18.759
Half the bag is filled with water.

03:18.760 --> 03:19.760
I'll go find her.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.639
Look at you. Don't go.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.040
It's not easy for Ms. Liu to run a business.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.200
Don't cause trouble.

03:25.201 --> 03:26.599
- Mom. - What did I tell you?

03:26.600 --> 03:27.920
It's a blessing to suffer losses.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.896
The more losses you suffer, the more blessings you gain.

03:29.920 --> 03:30.920
Yes, Mom.

03:30.921 --> 03:32.839
That's how we've lived all these years.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.079
But today is different.

03:34.080 --> 03:35.160
Yue Yue is coming today.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.440
That's right.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.240
Why isn't she here yet?

03:40.080 --> 03:41.080
It's fine.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.679
She was always late when we went on dates.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.160
She should be around the area by now.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.680
It's not easy to find this place. I'll go out and pick her up.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.919
He lives in such a poor place.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.360
It's stinky and dirty.

04:06.320 --> 04:07.320
Yue Yue.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.160
Yue Yue!

04:10.120 --> 04:11.120
Yue Yue!

04:11.520 --> 04:12.600
You're here, Yue Yue.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.456
We can eat once we go inside. My mom already finished cooking.

04:16.480 --> 04:17.480
And you know what?

04:17.600 --> 04:19.560
My mom is really happy that you're here.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.080
I'm not here to eat today.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.560
I have something to tell you.

04:24.600 --> 04:25.920
Yue Yue, go ahead.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.480
Wu Qi Qiong.

04:27.560 --> 04:28.560
Let's break up.

04:31.280 --> 04:32.280
Why, Yue Yue?

04:32.480 --> 04:33.720
Why do we have to break up?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
Didn't you promise to come to my house for a meal?

04:36.040 --> 04:37.040
Why are we breaking up all of a sudden?

04:37.040 --> 04:38.040
All of a sudden?

04:38.041 --> 04:40.201
I used to like you because you were at least handsome.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.479
Look at you now.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.200
I'm embarrassed to be with you.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Yue Yue.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.696
What kind of man do you like? I can change.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.320
I can change back to how I was, Yue Yue.

04:49.640 --> 04:50.776
We've been together for so long.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.040
We're even discussing marriage.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.080
Wang Zhen Long, what are you doing?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.680
Look at how useless this loser is.

05:03.680 --> 05:04.880
What's the point of talking...

05:04.920 --> 05:05.920
to someone like him?

05:08.600 --> 05:09.600
- You can do it! - You can do it!

05:09.601 --> 05:10.656
- Go, Young Master Guo! - You can do it!

05:10.680 --> 05:11.680
Go for it!

05:11.681 --> 05:12.879
You can do it!

05:12.880 --> 05:14.640
- Go for it! - Go for it!

05:26.480 --> 05:27.560
Today,

05:28.360 --> 05:29.360
you'll surely lose.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.520
Weren't they best friends before?

05:42.840 --> 05:44.896
Aren't they tired of fighting after all these years?

05:44.920 --> 05:46.599
Whose snake do you think will win, Young Master Chi's...

05:46.600 --> 05:48.000
or Young Master Guo's?

05:48.680 --> 05:49.799
Isn't it obvious?

05:49.800 --> 05:51.200
Young Master Chi always wins.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.759
I heard Young Master Guo paid a lot to bring the black snake...

05:54.760 --> 05:55.839
back from South America.

05:55.840 --> 05:58.040
Today, Young Master Guo will surely turn things around.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
Go for it!

06:00.001 --> 06:01.039
Go, Young Master Guo!

06:01.040 --> 06:02.199
- Kill him! - Kill him!

06:02.200 --> 06:03.560
- Go for it! - Kill him!

06:03.920 --> 06:05.240
Young Master Guo stands a chance!

06:06.600 --> 06:07.680
- Go! - You can do it!

06:11.840 --> 06:13.200
Young Master Guo is winning!

06:13.440 --> 06:14.440
Baby!

06:14.441 --> 06:15.520
Kill him! Go!

06:18.880 --> 06:19.880
Bite him!

06:19.920 --> 06:21.040
Bite him!

06:24.960 --> 06:25.960
Bite him!

06:26.480 --> 06:27.480
Bite him!

06:27.920 --> 06:28.959
- Come on! - Come on! Bite him!

06:28.960 --> 06:29.960
Bite him!

06:39.040 --> 06:40.040
Go for it!

06:50.440 --> 06:51.440
He lost again.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.480
- Yes! - Yes!

06:53.481 --> 06:55.040
- Young Master Chi! - Nice!

07:05.600 --> 07:06.720
It's okay, guys.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.160
Even if I lost...

07:09.000 --> 07:10.160
I'm still happy!

07:11.160 --> 07:12.239
Young Master Guo, you're so generous!

07:12.240 --> 07:13.240
Young Master Guo, you're awesome!

07:13.241 --> 07:14.400
Thank you, Young Master Guo!

07:15.080 --> 07:16.240
Young Master Guo, I love you!

07:18.400 --> 07:19.760
Mr. Chi, you're awesome!

07:21.440 --> 07:22.440
Don't worry.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.760
I'm willing to admit defeat.

07:26.840 --> 07:27.840
The prize.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.440
The prize?

07:34.720 --> 07:36.480
Forget it if you can't bear to part with it.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.120
Li Wang.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.320
Come on.

07:45.240 --> 07:46.240
Xiao Long.

07:46.920 --> 07:49.480
He is my best friend, Chi Cheng.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.760
Go keep him company.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.160
You got him now.

07:55.440 --> 07:56.480
Have fun.

08:08.040 --> 08:12.000
- Chi Cheng! - Chi Cheng!

08:17.960 --> 08:19.880
(Health and tranquility, no illness or disaster)

08:21.640 --> 08:24.039
Dr. Jiang, I know you like desserts.

08:24.040 --> 08:26.160
I made this cake especially for you.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.640
- Thank you, Ms. Mei Li. - You're welcome.

08:32.480 --> 08:33.759
Mr. Li.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.360
This isn't good for your cervical spine.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.279
- Ms. Mei Li, you look beautiful. - Use a mirror to look.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.359
That's right.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.879
Nini just bought me lipstick.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.439
Is Wu Qi Qiong who was sent here yesterday awake now?

08:42.440 --> 08:43.440
Yes, he is.

08:43.560 --> 08:44.840
Is this a present for me?

08:48.120 --> 08:49.200
What a glutton.

09:12.840 --> 09:13.840
Everything is fine now.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.040
- It hurts. - Don't move around.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.120
I just changed your dressing.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.280
Where am I?

09:22.520 --> 09:23.760
You're at a clinic.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.080
Your friend brought you here.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.320
My friend?

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
Slow down.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.640
Was it a girl?

09:33.120 --> 09:34.520
It was a guy and a girl.

09:34.920 --> 09:36.760
That girl specifically told me...

09:37.240 --> 09:38.840
to use the cheapest medicine.

09:39.240 --> 09:40.720
And the kind that can be reimbursed.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.080
She knows me the best.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.360
Let me tell you. She's my girlfriend.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.239
Girlfriend?

09:49.240 --> 09:50.240
Yes.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.360
Then who's that guy?

09:53.600 --> 09:55.800
That guy might be her friend.

09:56.640 --> 09:57.760
Or maybe...

09:58.480 --> 09:59.480
a friendly passerby.

10:00.920 --> 10:02.600
A friendly passerby?

10:02.880 --> 10:03.880
Hey, man.

10:03.960 --> 10:05.240
I think you're being cheated on.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.280
Okay, I admit it.

10:10.680 --> 10:11.680
Actually,

10:12.040 --> 10:13.240
it's not her fault.

10:13.640 --> 10:14.720
It's because I've become...

10:15.080 --> 10:16.080
ugly,

10:16.080 --> 10:17.080
tacky,

10:17.080 --> 10:18.080
and fat.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.280
I think...

10:22.600 --> 10:23.720
you have a good foundation.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.040
Really?

10:28.360 --> 10:29.360
Trust me.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.960
You should shave first.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.120
- Get a cool hairstyle. - What style do you want?

10:37.640 --> 10:38.640
The cooler, the better.

10:39.480 --> 10:40.880
Okay, can you do this hairstyle?

10:41.120 --> 10:42.279
No problem.

10:42.280 --> 10:43.960
Dress more neatly.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.840
Losing weight is the hardest. You must persevere.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.560
Have a complete makeover.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.960
I'm sure your girlfriend will go back to you.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.160
I'm here again.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.160
- You're here. - Here.

11:13.161 --> 11:14.616
Congratulations, you've collected them all.

11:14.640 --> 11:15.640
Thank you.

11:37.160 --> 11:41.120
I did it!

12:01.360 --> 12:03.399
- Hello? - Chi Cheng, where are you?

12:03.400 --> 12:04.639
Your dad is in the hospital.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.960
Come back quickly.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.080
Okay, got it.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.440
I know everything.

12:12.480 --> 12:13.519
It's okay.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.520
Young Master Chi.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.319
Keep an eye on the snake.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.320
- Okay. - Okay.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.760
What's wrong? Are you jealous?

12:23.560 --> 12:24.640
You Green-Eyed Monster.

12:37.800 --> 12:38.800
Mom.

12:43.360 --> 12:45.120
Why did you bring this home again?

12:45.960 --> 12:47.296
You're not at the hospital with Dad.

12:47.320 --> 12:48.679
The caregiver is there,

12:48.680 --> 12:50.160
so I came back first to wait for you.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.800
- Let's go. - Where to?

12:53.680 --> 12:54.840
To see Dad at the hospital.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.960
There's no rush. Let's go tomorrow.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.680
Your dad is asleep now anyway.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.640
I should've come here tomorrow.

13:06.360 --> 13:07.360
I'm going to bed, Mom.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.520
Can't you spend more time with me at home?

13:34.040 --> 13:35.080
Talk.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.839
Young Master Chi, we're in trouble.

13:36.840 --> 13:38.000
Someone robbed the snake den.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.719
What did you say?

13:42.720 --> 13:44.440
Someone robbed the snake den.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.720
How did that happen?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.280
I don't know.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.959
I think Da Kun and I were drugged last night.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.079
We slept so soundly.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.200
When I woke up, it was past 9am.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.280
The snakes in the glass case were all gone.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.160
The ones in your room were also taken away.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.960
Where's Xiao Long?

14:01.160 --> 14:02.160
I don't know.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.880
He was gone when I woke up.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.000
Stop telling me nonsense.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.120
You must find Xiao Long for me.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.080
Aren't you hospitalized?

14:21.600 --> 14:23.280
It was a diversion, wasn't it?

14:25.080 --> 14:26.200
I knew it.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.119
I've arranged everything.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.919
Go and work at the company's Property Department next week.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.200
Start from the bottom.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.120
I'm taking the back door.

14:37.121 --> 14:38.240
Try it and you'll see!

14:43.840 --> 14:45.760
Look at how you are fooling around.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.960
You're already 28 years old.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.000
You don't even have a proper job.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.760
Look at Guo Cheng Yu.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.240
His company is doing so well.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.639
He likes to have fun too.

14:55.640 --> 14:57.360
But he's not neglecting official matters.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.280
You can let him call you "Dad".

15:00.600 --> 15:01.640
I'm fine with that.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.960
And I wish I had a different son.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.280
People have been calling my office to complain.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.399
They say my son is a pervert,

15:09.400 --> 15:10.599
who leads a promiscuous personal life.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.960
How can I face people?

15:21.160 --> 15:24.000
If you want your snakes to live,

15:24.080 --> 15:25.800
go to work.

15:33.560 --> 15:35.160
Table A36.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.320
Table A36 is ready.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.280
Yue Yue.

15:51.400 --> 15:52.400
You're here.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.080
Look, I've lost weight again.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.696
Let's go. I'll treat you to something delicious.

15:56.720 --> 15:57.880
Wu Qi Qiong!

15:58.200 --> 15:59.520
Can you stop bothering me?

16:00.200 --> 16:01.640
I'm here today to tell you...

16:01.880 --> 16:03.400
that it's impossible between us.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.320
Don't text me anymore.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.080
Why, Yue Yue?

16:07.920 --> 16:10.359
You complained that I was fat, sloppy,

16:10.360 --> 16:11.559
and unpresentable.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.160
I've changed. I can change.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.400
It's not about being sloppy or not.

16:15.480 --> 16:17.040
I just don't like how poor you are.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.959
My friends are using designer bags and eating fancy food.

16:19.960 --> 16:21.160
But with you,

16:21.200 --> 16:22.599
I only eat ramen and spicy hot pot every day.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.240
Have you ever treated me to a good meal?

16:24.320 --> 16:25.840
- Aren't we here now? - A37!

16:26.120 --> 16:27.800
- Is Table A37 here? - I'm here.

16:27.880 --> 16:28.880
This is a popular restaurant.

16:28.881 --> 16:30.536
- I waited in line for over an hour. - You can eat now.

16:30.560 --> 16:31.800
Here's my table number.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.160
I have a coupon too.

16:35.080 --> 16:38.360
This coupon can only be used for weekday lunches.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.160
I'm sorry.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.240
Yue Yue.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.120
Yue Yue.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.360
Look, we're short by over 100 yuan.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.719
Let's go somewhere else. Let's go to another place, okay?

16:53.720 --> 16:54.720
Let's go.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.079
Look how poor you are.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.920
You should find someone else to drag down too.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.240
Wang Zhen Long!

17:04.560 --> 17:06.479
I told you. There's no point talking to him.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.560
Who are you?

17:07.760 --> 17:08.760
What are you looking at?

17:09.720 --> 17:11.120
Wu Qi Qiong,

17:11.160 --> 17:12.616
your name sounds like "endless poverty".

17:12.640 --> 17:13.800
With your name,

17:14.040 --> 17:15.880
you'll never turn the tables in this lifetime.

17:17.120 --> 17:18.120
Let's go.

17:34.800 --> 17:35.960
Hello?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.640
Hey, sir.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.040
Okay. I'll be right there.

17:49.640 --> 17:52.200
- Sir. - Why are you only here now?

17:53.280 --> 17:56.480
You always ask me to give you projects and a raise.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.400
But you're not here when I need you.

17:58.800 --> 17:59.960
Why are you staring at me?

18:00.280 --> 18:02.160
I asked you to come to fix this.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.920
Why are you looking at me? Fix it.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.040
Okay. I'll fix it now.

18:29.480 --> 18:30.480
What?

18:30.520 --> 18:32.399
Sir, this is broken.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.000
We need to replace this.

18:34.920 --> 18:36.279
This was fine before.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.320
Did you break it?

18:37.440 --> 18:38.440
No.

18:38.441 --> 18:39.601
It was broken from the start.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.360
Hey, Wu Qi Qiong.

18:42.240 --> 18:43.240
You are...

18:43.400 --> 18:45.320
too narrow-minded.

18:46.520 --> 18:49.040
You should pay for this first.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.240
Next month,

18:50.440 --> 18:52.096
get a reimbursement from the Finance Department.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.999
You haven't reimbursed me for the delivery last month.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
My salary this month is less than 5,000 yuan.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.079
If you think the company doesn't pay you well,

18:58.080 --> 18:59.320
you can quit.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.720
Don't occupy the position.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.000
How dare you negotiate with me?

19:04.520 --> 19:06.440
Look at yourself.

19:06.520 --> 19:07.520
Let me tell you.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.159
If you pay up quickly today,

19:10.160 --> 19:11.600
this matter will be over.

19:11.720 --> 19:14.200
Yue Yue thinks I'm poor and found someone else.

19:14.280 --> 19:17.600
And my boss is bullying me. Everyone looks down on me.

19:24.440 --> 19:25.559
I'm resigning.

19:25.560 --> 19:26.560
I quit!

19:44.200 --> 19:45.200
Wait.

19:45.840 --> 19:46.840
Wu Qi Qiong.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.560
It's only been a few days.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.120
Why are you here again?

19:51.680 --> 19:52.720
I changed my name.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.240
To what?

19:55.960 --> 19:57.000
"Wu Suo Wei."

20:09.760 --> 20:11.000
I'm going to counterattack.

20:12.480 --> 20:13.480
What?

20:13.840 --> 20:15.240
I'm going to counterattack.

20:15.640 --> 20:16.640
What attack?

20:18.440 --> 20:22.439
I'm going to counterattack!

20:22.440 --> 20:24.760
(I'm going to counterattack! Wu Qi Qiong)

20:30.160 --> 20:31.240
- Welcome. - Welcome.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.679
Thank you, Xiao Shuai, for taking me in.

20:34.680 --> 20:35.680
It's fine.

20:35.681 --> 20:38.039
I was looking for someone to watch the place for me anyway.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.439
- Yes! - The thing is,

20:39.440 --> 20:40.879
I want to start my own business.

20:40.880 --> 20:42.959
But I'm afraid my mom will find out and worry about me,

20:42.960 --> 20:44.919
so it's not convenient for me to stay at home.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.240
Have you decided what to do then?

20:46.680 --> 20:47.680
Yes.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.320
I'm going to sell sugar figures.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.776
I'll set up a stall at the night market near Hope City.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.359
I heard it's very strict there.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.000
It's okay. I've already checked it out.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.000
Sugar figures!

20:58.320 --> 20:59.320
Fruits!

20:59.321 --> 21:01.560
We're managing this place so well.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.920
The management fees are paid on time.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.759
- The manager is here. Let's go. - Hurry, go.

21:07.760 --> 21:09.640
Wait for me!

21:10.120 --> 21:12.119
Sir, why are they running?

21:12.120 --> 21:14.440
This street is owned by Yuanduan Group.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.720
If you set up a stall here, you need a permit.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.479
- If you don't have a permit, - Yuanduan Group?

21:18.480 --> 21:19.639
You must run when you see people conducting an inspection.

21:19.640 --> 21:20.800
Did you get a permit?

21:21.240 --> 21:23.839
I run a small business and I move around a lot.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.040
That's not necessary.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.559
Then aren't you afraid of getting caught?

21:26.560 --> 21:28.279
Come on. Let me tell you.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.919
His nickname is Hei Zi.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.159
He has always protected us.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.839
Ordinary managers don't dare to offend him at all.

21:33.840 --> 21:34.840
That's great!

21:34.841 --> 21:35.920
Melons from Xinjiang!

21:36.520 --> 21:38.296
- Young Master Chi. - What are you yelling about?

21:38.320 --> 21:40.600
- This bearded guy is the worst. - What?

21:40.680 --> 21:42.120
Since he's powerful,

21:42.200 --> 21:43.496
he always bullies the stall owners.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.760
See how Hei Zi will teach him a lesson.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.080
Darn you!

21:48.440 --> 21:49.960
- Nice. - What are you doing?

21:50.440 --> 21:51.440
What are you looking at?

21:51.960 --> 21:52.960
You...

22:05.680 --> 22:07.920
- You... - Darn you!

22:18.880 --> 22:19.999
Sir.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.520
The guy in the suit is even cooler.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.320
Excuse me.

22:24.760 --> 22:25.959
Serves you right.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.600
Hurry, get up.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.960
Young Master Chi, when it comes to these unruly hawkers,

22:32.200 --> 22:33.200
you have to use force.

22:33.201 --> 22:34.560
Watch what I'll do to them.

22:42.680 --> 22:43.680
Hey.

23:11.680 --> 23:12.719
Li Wang.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.600
- Did you hire him? - I don't know him.

23:17.440 --> 23:18.440
Young Master Chi.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.440
Go after him!

23:23.080 --> 23:24.200
You bastard.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.400
Don't let me catch you.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.120
Let's go...

23:30.640 --> 23:32.320
and meet this master.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.399
What's wrong? Why are you panicking?

23:39.400 --> 23:40.960
Someone's coming.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.760
Don't tell anyone I'm here.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.000
Okay.

23:45.001 --> 23:46.039
- Hide in there first. - Okay.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.200
- Don't make a sound. - Okay.

23:49.280 --> 23:50.360
Don't make a sound!

24:08.760 --> 24:09.760
Can I help you?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.000
I'm looking for someone.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.159
Who?

24:12.160 --> 24:13.160
Well...

24:13.400 --> 24:15.480
I want to have a consultation with you.

24:16.760 --> 24:17.760
Okay.

24:17.920 --> 24:18.920
Have a seat.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.599
Tell me. Where do you feel unwell?

24:24.600 --> 24:25.680
Take a guess.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.479
If it's a gynecological problem,

24:27.480 --> 24:29.176
go to an obstetrics and gynecology hospital.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.399
Go out, turn left, and walk 30 meters.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.000
The No. 2 line takes you straight there.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.200
You're so good-looking.

24:39.480 --> 24:40.600
If you have dim eyesight,

24:40.760 --> 24:42.360
go to Tongren Hospital.

24:47.960 --> 24:49.040
You like men, don't you?

24:51.880 --> 24:53.000
If you're mentally ill,

24:53.200 --> 24:54.800
go to the mental hospital.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.200
"Jiang..."

25:03.400 --> 25:04.400
"Xiao..."

25:04.760 --> 25:05.760
"Shuai."

25:07.960 --> 25:09.080
I'll remember you.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.919
- Is he gone? - Yes.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.800
(Medical Area, Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out)

25:21.400 --> 25:23.120
I encountered my nemesis.

25:23.960 --> 25:25.199
I can't be a street vendor anymore.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.360
I need to find another job.

25:41.680 --> 25:42.840
Dr. Xiao Shuai.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.000
How come you've never had a girlfriend?

25:50.200 --> 25:51.200
Because...

25:51.800 --> 25:53.320
I've had a boyfriend.

25:56.480 --> 25:57.640
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

25:59.800 --> 26:00.800
Wait.

26:01.280 --> 26:02.680
Do you like men?

26:10.040 --> 26:11.040
What's wrong?

26:11.040 --> 26:12.040
Are you scared?

26:17.440 --> 26:18.640
No.

26:20.200 --> 26:21.200
It's okay.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.680
I'll get going then.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.160
When did you take it?

26:38.520 --> 26:39.800
When you were talking just now.

26:40.480 --> 26:42.680
My second business is about to start.

26:42.760 --> 26:43.880
Wish me a triumphant return.

26:44.680 --> 26:45.680
Where are you going?

27:07.200 --> 27:08.319
Hello, Chi Zi.

27:08.320 --> 27:10.120
You didn't come to this year's reunion again.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.080
I had to entertain clients.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.479
I couldn't get away.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.280
What? Save it.

27:16.520 --> 27:17.520
You,

27:17.521 --> 27:18.679
Guo Cheng Yu,

27:18.680 --> 27:20.440
and Wang Shuo, the snake lover,

27:20.960 --> 27:23.160
were so close back then.

27:23.320 --> 27:24.320
And now...

27:42.640 --> 27:43.640
Okay, guys.

27:43.641 --> 27:46.680
After the first two successes, let's look for the third one.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.599
I found him, guys.

27:51.600 --> 27:52.720
Let me show you, okay?

27:53.040 --> 27:56.359
(Nice, very handsome! So tall and handsome!)

27:56.360 --> 27:57.399
Isn't he nice?

27:57.400 --> 27:59.119
Okay. Let's test him today.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.959
We're already connected to a hidden camera.

28:00.960 --> 28:02.719
I need to record the whole process later.

28:02.720 --> 28:05.360
The moment we turn off our phones, a miracle will happen.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.520
(So exciting! He's so handsome!)

28:27.920 --> 28:28.920
Are you okay?

28:31.320 --> 28:32.320
Thank you.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.120
You faked a fall.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.320
You pretended to hold me up. Why can't I fake a fall?

28:45.560 --> 28:46.560
Sir.

28:46.561 --> 28:47.680
I'm really not a thief.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.560
I'm just a vlogger.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.200
I'll return the phone to you.

28:51.640 --> 28:52.640
Sir, look.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.160
Do you believe me now?

28:55.240 --> 28:56.320
I'm really not a thief.

28:58.520 --> 28:59.560
What are you doing?

29:00.000 --> 29:01.000
Sir.

29:01.760 --> 29:02.999
I'm really not a thief.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
It's true.

29:08.760 --> 29:10.600
- You came to me yourself. - No, sir.

29:10.680 --> 29:11.920
Have we met before?

29:13.400 --> 29:16.040
Sir, I really have proof that I'm not a thief.

29:16.160 --> 29:17.160
Let me show you.

29:21.400 --> 29:22.400
Look.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.960
I have an anti-pickpocket account.

29:24.160 --> 29:26.200
You're just a random passerby that I picked.

29:26.440 --> 29:28.879
This is to teach everyone common sense about thieves,

29:28.880 --> 29:30.039
so you won't run into one.

29:30.040 --> 29:32.239
It's true! The live stream viewers can vouch for me.

29:32.240 --> 29:33.440
Look.

29:34.880 --> 29:35.880
Look.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.080
Am I right?

29:37.081 --> 29:38.439
(Vlogger left for a moment. More content after the break.)

29:38.440 --> 29:39.440
Right?

29:48.520 --> 29:49.760
What's your name?

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Wu Suo Wei.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Did you say "whatever"?

29:53.600 --> 29:54.960
- You're so cocky. - No, sir.

29:56.000 --> 29:57.160
My name is really Wu Suo Wei.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.760
I have proof too. Wait.

30:01.120 --> 30:02.120
Here's my ID card.

30:04.320 --> 30:05.320
Look.

30:08.280 --> 30:09.559
Your name is really Wu Suo Wei.

30:09.560 --> 30:10.560
Yes, sir.

30:10.561 --> 30:11.816
- It's a misunderstanding. - You've got pizzazz.

30:11.840 --> 30:12.840
I don't.

30:16.760 --> 30:17.760
Darn it.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.720
Why did you throw candy at me that day?

30:23.440 --> 30:26.359
Sir, that day, I didn't want to throw it at you.

30:26.360 --> 30:27.720
I wanted to throw it around you...

30:27.960 --> 30:28.960
I...

30:28.961 --> 30:30.119
I didn't want to throw it at anyone.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.760
Sir, I'm sorry.

30:32.720 --> 30:33.720
It's my fault.

30:35.960 --> 30:36.960
Sir.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.520
Sir. Don't go, sir!

30:48.800 --> 30:49.800
Don't.

30:49.801 --> 30:50.920
I'll give you two choices.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.320
You can either be this exposé vlogger and get beaten up by me...

30:55.520 --> 30:56.520
or...

30:58.160 --> 30:59.199
I'll confiscate your equipment.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.240
I choose to get beaten up.

31:01.440 --> 31:02.440
A choice has been made.

31:04.360 --> 31:05.479
Sir.

31:05.480 --> 31:06.480
Give it back to me, sir.

31:06.481 --> 31:08.319
I bought it with a lot of money. Sir, give it back to me.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.400
Sir!

31:17.200 --> 31:18.200
Young Master Chi.

31:27.400 --> 31:29.040
Mr. Chi, we've brought him back.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.000
He was trying to flee the country.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.440
Mr. Chi.

31:37.680 --> 31:38.880
Let me explain.

31:39.680 --> 31:42.200
Your dad brought dozens of people to the suburbs overnight.

31:43.040 --> 31:44.200
I was so scared.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.360
Your dad interrogated me himself.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.400
Otherwise, I wouldn't have said anything.

31:48.720 --> 31:50.160
Who are you trying to freaking fool?

31:50.360 --> 31:52.080
You called the Chairman's Office.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.200
That phone belongs to Guo Cheng Yu's lackey, right?

31:54.440 --> 31:56.319
When the chairman drove to the suburbs,

31:56.320 --> 31:58.000
you were already freaking gone.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.320
Come here.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.000
Mr. Chi.

32:12.600 --> 32:13.600
Mr. Chi.

32:17.680 --> 32:18.880
What do you guys think of him?

32:19.320 --> 32:20.320
Not bad.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.520
We all quite like him.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.080
We all like you.

32:24.800 --> 32:26.639
No.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.080
You guys can have fun with him then.

32:29.200 --> 32:30.240
I'll get going.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.039
Mr. Chi.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.080
Mr. Chi.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.520
- Mr. Chi. - Be good.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.159
- Get lost. - Mr. Chi.

32:37.160 --> 32:38.840
Mr. Chi, I'm sorry.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.759
Mr. Chi, it's my fault.

32:40.760 --> 32:42.520
Mr. Chi!

32:43.760 --> 32:44.959
Let go of me!

32:44.960 --> 32:46.279
- Let go! - Watch them.

32:46.280 --> 32:48.600
- Mr. Chi! - Don't let him die.

32:48.640 --> 32:49.839
I'm sorry!

32:49.840 --> 32:50.999
Let go of me!

32:51.000 --> 32:52.160
Let go!

32:52.480 --> 32:53.600
Mr. Chi!

32:54.080 --> 32:55.400
Let me go!

32:55.880 --> 33:00.680
(Shengshi Club)

33:05.000 --> 33:06.200
Whose car is this?

33:06.600 --> 33:07.880
It's in my way, you know?

33:08.280 --> 33:09.280
Darn it!

33:11.920 --> 33:13.440
- Darn it. - Does he know how to park?

33:13.560 --> 33:14.560
Young Master Chi.

33:21.280 --> 33:22.400
Is this your car?

33:23.160 --> 33:24.280
Start driving and get lost.

33:24.680 --> 33:25.680
Or I'll smash it.

33:31.560 --> 33:33.760
What are you waiting for? Get lost.

33:38.880 --> 33:39.880
Idiot.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.920
Only a man like him deserves me.

34:14.240 --> 34:15.360
Don't touch me.

34:16.920 --> 34:18.120
Focus on driving.

34:19.400 --> 34:20.640
What's wrong with you today?

34:22.960 --> 34:23.960
Nothing.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.200
Darn it, he's flashing his lights at me.

34:32.280 --> 34:33.840
- Darn it. - Slow down.

34:34.160 --> 34:35.320
Let him pass.

34:49.040 --> 34:50.240
Wang Zhen Long.

34:50.840 --> 34:52.400
Wake up.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.200
Wang Zhen Long.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.640
Say something.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.880
Why did you tell me to come back this time?

36:03.480 --> 36:06.000
You act as if I owe you something as soon as you're back.

36:06.520 --> 36:07.799
I'll give you a year.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.720
If you can't find a girlfriend, marry whoever I ask you to.

36:11.440 --> 36:12.440
Sure,

36:12.441 --> 36:13.641
if she's not afraid of snakes.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.440
Do you have to have that thing with you?

36:17.040 --> 36:18.759
Our son doesn't have a girlfriend yet.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.840
No matter what you say now, he won't listen.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.559
When he gets a girlfriend,

36:22.560 --> 36:24.199
he'll know his priorities.

36:24.200 --> 36:25.200
Right, son?

36:29.880 --> 36:30.880
Let me ask you.

36:30.920 --> 36:32.319
Wang's son is paralyzed from the waist down.

36:32.320 --> 36:33.840
Do you have anything to do with it?

36:35.040 --> 36:36.040
Who is it?

36:37.520 --> 36:38.599
I don't know him.

36:38.600 --> 36:39.799
You'd better not.

36:39.800 --> 36:40.920
Come on, Green-Eyed Monster.

36:42.560 --> 36:43.800
Let's go home and sleep.

36:45.880 --> 36:47.240
You're leaving again?

36:49.160 --> 36:51.080
I wonder who he got his bad temper from.

36:53.720 --> 36:54.720
What do you think?

37:14.080 --> 37:15.840
You're finally here.

37:29.240 --> 37:30.960
Xiao Shuai, you're still here?

37:43.280 --> 37:44.560
I forgot you like men.

37:58.360 --> 37:59.919
Are you trying to avoid me...

37:59.920 --> 38:01.280
or seduce me?

38:03.240 --> 38:04.240
I'm sorry.

38:10.600 --> 38:11.760
What's wrong?

38:11.840 --> 38:13.680
It's like someone owes you eight million yuan.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.200
Don't get me started.

38:15.480 --> 38:17.120
I can't do live streaming anymore.

38:17.240 --> 38:18.520
My equipment was confiscated.

38:18.920 --> 38:20.360
If you can't do it, just quit it.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.040
Help me think.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.080
Is there anything else I can do?

38:26.480 --> 38:28.120
I have a relative who has a truck.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.000
He usually just delivers stuff.

38:30.240 --> 38:31.640
Why don't you work with them first?

38:32.560 --> 38:33.680
You get paid per order.

38:33.720 --> 38:34.760
And your time is flexible.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.400
That's good.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.000
I'm sorry.

39:09.800 --> 39:10.800
You've recovered?

39:14.480 --> 39:16.280
Seeing you makes me all better.

39:18.880 --> 39:19.880
How cheesy.

39:30.440 --> 39:31.560
You feel cold?

39:32.720 --> 39:34.160
I've been standing here outside.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.040
Of course I feel cold.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.960
There's a python in my car.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.520
I love snakes.

39:42.840 --> 39:43.840
I'll go take a look.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.040
This snake...

40:09.720 --> 40:11.120
is so cute.

40:20.520 --> 40:21.600
All right.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.400
I can use you to deal with my dad...

40:24.960 --> 40:26.400
and get my snakes back.

40:43.080 --> 40:44.840
We've searched everywhere.

40:45.240 --> 40:47.079
We're also keeping an eye on the chairman's car.

40:47.080 --> 40:49.319
But the chairman always just goes to two places,

40:49.320 --> 40:50.920
the office and home.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.840
He doesn't go anywhere else.

41:06.800 --> 41:08.240
Can they possibly be in the office?

41:08.880 --> 41:09.880
I don't think so.

41:10.720 --> 41:11.960
With so many snakes,

41:12.320 --> 41:13.679
aside from having a big enclosure,

41:13.680 --> 41:15.080
they need people to supervise them.

41:15.560 --> 41:16.640
If they're in the office,

41:17.360 --> 41:18.880
it won't go unnoticed.

41:19.360 --> 41:20.360
Have you forgotten?

41:23.520 --> 41:25.640
They built a new storage base in the office.

41:29.360 --> 41:30.440
Xiao Wu.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.680
Since Xiao Shuai referred you, I feel at ease.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.319
But I have to remind you.

41:34.320 --> 41:35.776
This batch of goods is very important.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.880
We need the chairman's approval to unload the goods.

41:38.240 --> 41:39.320
Don't worry.

41:39.440 --> 41:40.679
For this batch of goods,

41:40.680 --> 41:42.839
no one can open it.

41:42.840 --> 41:43.840
I assure you.

41:44.040 --> 41:45.440
Okay, I believe you.

41:46.320 --> 41:47.320
Here.

41:59.720 --> 42:00.720
Okay, stop.

42:05.560 --> 42:06.560
Sir.

42:08.880 --> 42:09.880
Here.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.239
What's in the truck?

42:21.240 --> 42:22.240
Open it.

42:22.560 --> 42:23.560
Who are you?

42:24.000 --> 42:25.200
Why should I open it for you?

42:25.840 --> 42:27.039
The chairman said...

42:27.040 --> 42:29.000
no one can open this batch of goods.

42:34.360 --> 42:35.360
Mr. Chi.

42:35.680 --> 42:37.560
- We found the snakes. - What's going on?

42:38.360 --> 42:39.679
He works for Young Master Chi.

42:39.680 --> 42:40.680
Just open it for him.

42:40.681 --> 42:42.199
Who is Young Master Chi?

42:42.200 --> 42:43.359
No one can open it.

42:43.360 --> 42:45.479
- Why would I open it for no reason? - Here! Come on!

42:45.480 --> 42:47.280
- You're delaying me from money. - Here.

42:49.520 --> 42:50.520
Gang Zi.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.920
Come, pry it open for me.

42:57.040 --> 42:58.360
You can't open this truck!

42:58.440 --> 43:00.159
I promised no one could open it.

43:00.160 --> 43:01.399
Why are you yelling?

43:01.400 --> 43:03.040
- I am not just anyone. - Come on.

43:06.560 --> 43:07.560
Mr. Chi.

43:08.480 --> 43:09.480
It's full of spare parts.

43:14.600 --> 43:15.720
Didn't you say you found it?

43:17.520 --> 43:19.879
Darn it, who told you to open my truck?

43:19.880 --> 43:21.479
You have a truck full of spare parts.

43:21.480 --> 43:22.759
Why are you being so mysterious?

43:22.760 --> 43:24.720
I won't get paid this way.

43:24.920 --> 43:26.040
And you.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.080
Gosh.

43:29.200 --> 43:30.840
- It's you again. - It's you again.

43:30.920 --> 43:33.000
What do you freaking want?

43:33.120 --> 43:34.520
You're involved in everything I do.

43:34.920 --> 43:36.120
Who are you?

43:36.280 --> 43:38.040
This is Mr. Chi from the Storage Department.

43:39.280 --> 43:40.919
The Storage Department?

43:40.920 --> 43:42.399
I don't care which department you're from.

43:42.400 --> 43:43.400
Pay up.

43:44.800 --> 43:46.440
- How much? - Five hundred yuan.

43:49.120 --> 43:50.120
Gang Zi.

43:51.360 --> 43:52.440
Pay him 5,000 yuan.

43:53.280 --> 43:54.680
Come on, over here.

44:10.600 --> 44:11.840
Chi Cheng!

44:12.560 --> 44:14.559
- Mr. Chi's girlfriend is so pretty. - Yes.

44:14.560 --> 44:15.560
She's so beautiful.

44:16.960 --> 44:17.960
Why are you here?

44:18.880 --> 44:21.680
I was afraid I wouldn't be able to catch you after you get off work.

44:22.760 --> 44:23.880
- So sweet. - So sweet.

44:29.440 --> 44:30.840
What? Are you envious?

44:33.640 --> 44:35.120
Did you miss me?

44:37.440 --> 44:38.480
Let's go.

44:38.720 --> 44:39.759
Okay.

44:39.760 --> 44:40.760
Let's go.

44:46.840 --> 44:49.200
No wonder you've been picking a fight with me.

44:49.360 --> 44:51.880
I messed up a few jobs because of you.

44:52.040 --> 44:54.000
So you're Yue Yue's new boyfriend.

44:54.360 --> 44:56.200
You're doing this for her to get back at me.

44:59.520 --> 45:01.120
A gentleman...

45:01.320 --> 45:02.680
will surely take revenge.
